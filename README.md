# Kitchenplan

## Why Kitchenplan?

Read about this project and it's values and goals in this blog post: [http://vanderveer.be/blog/2013/04/14/presenting-kitchenplan/](http://vanderveer.be/blog/2013/04/14/presenting-kitchenplan/)

## Using Kitchenplan

### As a Kitchenplan maintainer for your organisation or for personal use.

I myself will use this version, so you can learn from my config files. But you best start of by forking this repo. You will need it to store your configuration files. [If you want to make it private, read up on how Boxen suggest you do this](https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen#bootstrapping)

### Getting started as a user

To get started, open up the App Store application and install the latest XCode. After XCode is installed, go to the Preferences and install the Command Line Tools. At this point you have both a compiler and a GIT binary, so we can go to the next step.

![Installing Command Line Tools](http://vanderveer.be/images/2012-04-21/Xcode-Downloads.png)

If the repo for your organisation is private, continue with setting up your SSH keys. Open up a Terminal window and run ```ssh-keygen```. After this command finishes, run ```cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub``` and copy the output. Put this in your Github account or where you need your private key in your repo hosting of your choice.

Now, to get Kitchenplan on your computer, run the following commands:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt
sudo chown -R $USER /opt
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/kitchenplan/kitchenplan.git kitchenplan # or your version
cd kitchenplan
```

Before you run the ```./kitchenplan``` command, first create a custom config file. The config system will always start of with ```default.yml```. This will contain the recipes for every person in your organisation. Next it it will look at the file ```yourusername.yml``` (with the username logged in on the computer as yourusername) for your custom settings. Ofcourse there will be a lot of shared config when your organisation has departments of different types of personel. So you can define group config files and assign one or more groups to a user. The ```roderik.yml``` ([found here](https://github.com/kitchenplan/kitchenplan/blob/master/config/people/roderik.yml)) is my personal config file, the ```travis.yml``` ([found here](https://github.com/kitchenplan/kitchenplan/blob/master/config/people/travis.yml)) is a full example, with both OSX and Ubuntu supported.

When you are done with that, run ```kitchenplan``` and wait for a while. After the command finishes, reboot your computer and you are good to go.

### Command line tools

There are some useful command line options, run ```kitchenplan -d``` or look here:

```
Usage: kitchenplan [options]
    -d, --debug                      Show debug information
    -c, --update-cookbooks           Update the Chef cookbooks
        --[no-]soloist               Run soloist (defaults to yes)
        --[no-]update                Run the kitchenplan update (defaults to yes)

Common options:
    -h, --help                       Show this message
        --version                    Show version
```

### Caveat

We are running this project in production for both OSX and Ubuntu development machines. So I'm pretty sure it all works just fine. But, in the gap between two new installs, all the applications we install, and all community cookbooks are in constant development and can potentially break the install. I always suggest to our people that they run it first in a virtual machine (You can easily install OSX in a VMware Fusion trial, or use Vagrant for Linux testing).

### Want to contribute?

Fork and send pull requests or just idea's and issues via the issue tracker. If you need a new recipe, fork the chef-* repo's and change the url in the Cheffile to make it fetch your version. Add it and send a pull request. For now we support OSX and the debian family (only tested on Ubuntu). Other operating systems are welcome!
